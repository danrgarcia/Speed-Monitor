A quick python script that will will do a download/upload speed test every 10 minutes and log it into a postgres databse. 

After 1700 system time it will create a graph of your upload/download speeds and send an email out with the graph.

Future plans include adding an email alert when the speeds drop below a threshhold during the day as well as possibly comparing days to previous days.
